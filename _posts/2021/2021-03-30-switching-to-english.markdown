I've been contemplating making my blog multilingual for some time now, but I'm not at that level yet. The amount of time required for writing and editing blog posts in different languages is just crazy, and much respect for guys like [Mario Pinho](https://www.mariopinho.com) that have been supporting amazing multilingual blogs.

For now, I've decided to keep all my Portuguese blog posts as they are and write the future ones in English.


Best,

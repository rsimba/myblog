This post is related to the first section of the DEVASC-200-901 exam: 1.0 Software Development and Design (precisely, subsections 1.3 and 1.4). We must understand how application software are developed and the different development methods used during the process.
  
## Introduction
Software is a general term for different programs used to operate a computer; these programs are essentially a set of well-defined instructions for a computer to perform a specific task. There are two significant types of software: **system software** and **application software**.
 
Application software can be a simple program with a few lines of code or one with hundreds of thousands of lines of code. In either case, the development process looks very different; in the former example, the developer might not need to follow a specific process to build such a simple program. However, the latter case would require a manageable process, including practices and tools to simplify the overall development process. This process for developing software is known as Software Project Management.

The software industry started around 1960, and it has become one of the most critical industries. With the software demand, the industry saw a need to change how software was being developed and delivered to meet the growing demand. And so, Computer companies started to adopt the already established project management methods used in other industries to manage software development, and it was called Software project management.

Software project management is considered a subdiscipline of project management, and its philosophies, principles, methods, and practices apply to software development.

## Software Development Process
It is the act of dividing the software development process into small and manageable steps for better results. These well-defined steps are known as Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC); several models, known as System Development Methodology (SDM), are available to help guide the development process, at which order the SDLC steps are executed.

### Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
Can you imagine the process used to develop Uber's app and the amount of code? Developing and delivering an application software can be complex, time-consuming, and costly; SDLC was developed to solve these challenges and help software companies or developers build software with the lowest cost and highest quality in the shortest time possible.

SDLC divides the software development process into different stages, and in each stage is performed specific activities. Various stakeholders are involved in each stage:
1. **Requirement gathering and Analysis**: This is where specific application requirements are outlined. Here, all teams or stakeholders (operations, development, product owner, testers, and others) involved in the software development and delivery process meet to define each outlined requirement and attribute responsibilities.
2. **Design**: This is where the application is designed based on the requirements gathered in phase 1. Here the architectural and technical teams get involved in deciding the architecture of the solution.
3. **Implementation or coding**: This is where the application code begins to be written based on the  requirements and design. Here the operations team setup environment for the developer team to start writing the code.
4. **Testing**: This is where the application tests will start to see whether the application works as intended. Here the test team will start to test the application and report bugs for improvements.
5. **Deployment / Release**: This is when the software is deployed and released by the operations team to the general users.
6. **Maintenance**: This is when the operation team constantly monitors the application and infrastructure.

### System Development Methodology (SDM)
SDM is essentially a set of methods that helps guide how the different SDLC phases are performed. Each model has its philosophies, practice, and tools, and one can work better in a specific use case comparing with another. There are various models but below are the most known:
- Waterfall
- Agile
- V-Model
- Spiral
- Prototype
- TDD

We will discuss these methods in future posts.

# Summary
From a project management and software development point of view, the software is managed as a project to which project management skills, tools, and techniques are applied. It is strongly advisable to have an overview of project management.

Developers and software companies are constantly looking for efficient ways to develop and deliver software, and there is a growing number of proprietary and open standard software development methods.

Best,
